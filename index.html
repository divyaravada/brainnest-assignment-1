            <h3 id="movie1">Ratatouille</h3>
            <p>
              Brad Bird’s masterpiece about Remy, a rat who dreams of becoming a
              chef, is a touching portrait of a struggling artist. There’s a
              wordless moment near the end of Ratatouille, in which ice-cold,
              seemingly impenetrable food critic Anton Ego (Peter O’Toole) takes
              a bite of of Remy’s cooking, and is transported, joyously, to a
              childhood memory. The power of cinema.

            <h3 id="movie2">The Incredibles</h3>
            <p>
              The only good Fantastic Four movie further established Brad Bird
              as a new master of animation. The Incredibles is stylish, retro
              and breathlessly dynamic—among other things, it’s a modern action
              classic with more heart-stopping moments than most R-rated
              explosion fests. It was followed by a lucrative 2018 sequel that
              was entertaining but rushed, lacking the uncommonly slow burn,
              character-driven buildup that made the original so memorable.

            <p>
              Much has been said about the brilliance with which Pixar handles
              the topic of death and grieving. Case in point: Oscar-winning
              musical dramedy Coco, centered on an aspiring musician who finds
              himself in the colorful Land of the Dead.

            <p>
              We’re going to let go of the urge to make a let it go pun here.
              Disney’s 2013 smash and its slightly superior sequel are both
              among the highest-grossing films of all time, and it’s easy to be
              enchanted by the subversive, empowering messages for young girls
              here.

            <h3 id="movie5">Up!</h3>
            <p>
              The second animated film in history nominated for an Academy Award
              for Best Picture after Beauty and the Beast, Up! is Pixar at the
              peak of their powers, and their commitment to creating intelligent
              cinematic events that appeal to audiences young and old. The
              iconic, tear duct-depleting opening five minutes of Up! are a
              revelation for animated kid-friendly fare. The Oscar-nominated
              screenplay by Pete Docter, Bob Peterson, and Tom McCarthy (who
              later won an Oscar for writing Spotlight), doesn’t shy away from a
              bluntly somber depiction of child neglect. There’s also a flying
              balloon house, and a talking Golden Retriever. Bold, magnificent
              art and entertainment.
